    Args:
        embeddings: Matrix with the shape of ``[L, dim]``
        ids_query:  Tensor with the size of ``Q``, where ``Q <= n``. Each element is within the range ``(0, L - 1)``.
        ids_gallery:  Tensor with the size of ``G`` where ``G <= n``. Each element is within the range ``(0, L - 1)``.
                      May overlap with ``ids_query``.
        top_n: Number of neighbors to find and return.
        sequence_ids: Sequence identifiers with the size of ``L`` (if known).
        labels_gt: Ground truth labels of every element with the size of ``L`` (if known).
        bs: Batch size for computing distances to avoid OOM errors when processing the whole matrix at once.

    Returns:
        distances: Sorted distances from every query to the closest ``top_n`` galleries with the size of ``(Q, top_n)``.
        retrieved_ids: The corresponding ids of gallery items with the shape of ``(Q, top_n)``.
                       Each element is within the range ``(0, G - 1)``.
        gt_ids: Ids of the gallery items relevant to every query. Each element is within the range ``(0, G - 1)``.
                It's only computed if ``labels_gt`` is provided.
