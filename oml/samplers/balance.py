class BalanceSampler(IBatchSampler):
    """
    This kind of sampler can be used for both metric learning and
    classification task.

    Sampler with the given strategy for the dataset with L unique labels:
    - Selection n_labels of L labels for the 1st batch
    - Selection n_instances instances for each label for the 1st batch
    - Selection n_labels of L - n_labels remaining labels for 2nd batch
    - Selection n_instances instances for each label for the 2nd batch
    - ...

    The epoch ends when there are no labels left.
    So, the batch size is n_instances * n_labels except the last one.
    Thus, in each epoch, all the labels will be selected once, but this
    does not mean that all the instances will be selected during the epoch.
    One of the purposes of this sampler is to be used for
    forming triplets and pos/neg pairs inside the batch.
    To guarante existing of these pairs in the batch,
    n_labels and n_instances should be > 1. (1)

    Behavior in corner cases:
    - If a label does not contain n_instances,
    a choice will be made with repetition.
    - If L % n_labels == 1 then one of the labels should be dropped
    otherwise statement (1) will not be met.

    This type of sampling can be found in the classical paper of Person Re-Id,
    where n_labels equals 32 and n_instances equals 4:
    `In Defense of the Triplet Loss for Person Re-Identification`_.

    Args:
        labels: list of labels labels for each elem in the dataset
        n_labels: number of labels in a batch, should be > 1
        n_instances: number of instances of each label in a batch, should be > 1
