# Pipelines
Pipelines provide a way to run metric learning experiments via changing only the config file.
All you need is to prepare the `.csv` table which describes your dataset
(the format is explained [here](https://open-metric-learning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents/datasets.html)), so the converter
can be implemented in any programming language.
