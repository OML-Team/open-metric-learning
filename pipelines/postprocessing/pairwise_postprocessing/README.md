# Pairwise postprocessing (re-ranking)

If you are new to Pipelines idea, you can start with
[general overview](https://open-metric-learning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oml/pipelines_general.html).

This Pipeline is based on the following study, completed by the OML's team:

### [STIR: Siamese Transformer for Image Retrieval Postprocessing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13393v1)

In this work, we first construct a baseline model trained with
triplet loss with hard negatives mining that performs at the state of the art
level but remains simple. Second, we introduce a novel
approach for image retrieval postprocessing called Siamese Transformer
for Image Retrieval (STIR) that reranks several top outputs in a single
forward pass. Unlike previously proposed Reranking Transformers, STIR
does not rely on global/local feature extraction and directly compares a
query image and a retrieved candidate on pixel level with the usage of
attention mechanism. The resulting approach defines a new state of the
art on standard image retrieval datasets: Stanford Online Products and
DeepFashion In-shop.

## I. Train & validate a feature extractor

**DeepFashion Inshop**
```bash
python train_extractor.py dataset_root=data/InShop/ logs_root=logs/InShop
python validate_extractor.py dataset_root=data/Inshop/ weights=extractor_inshop.ckpt
```

**Stanford Online Products**
```bash
python train_extractor.py dataset_root=data/SOP/ logs_root=logs/SOP
python validate_extractor.py dataset_root=data/SOP/ weights=extractor_sop.ckpt
```

## II. Train & validate a postprocessor

**DeepFashion Inshop**
```bash
python train_postprocessor.py dataset_root=data/InShop/ logs_root=logs/InShop extractor_weights=extractor_inshop.ckpt
python validate_postprocessor.py dataset_root=data/InShop/ extractor_weights=extractor_inshop.ckpt postprocessor_weights=postprocessor_inshop.ckpt
```

**Stanford Online Products**
```bash
python train_postprocessor.py dataset_root=data/SOP/ logs_root=logs/SOP extractor_weights=extractor_sop.ckpt
python validate_postprocessor.py dataset_root=data/SOP/ extractor_weights=extractor_sop.ckpt postprocessor_weights=postprocessor_sop.ckpt
```
