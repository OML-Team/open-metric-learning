OML is a PyTorch-based framework to train and validate the models producing high-quality embeddings.

Specifically, our framework provides modules for supervised training and retrieval-like validation, and a single pipeline for them.
* **Training part** implies using losses, well-established for metric learning, such as the angular losses
 (like ArcFace) or the combinations based losses (like TripletLoss or ContrastiveLoss).
 The latter benefits from effective mining schemas of triplets/pairs, so we pay great attention to it.
 Thus, during the training we:
   1. Use `DataLoader` + `Sampler` to form batches (for example `BalanceSampler`)
   2. [Only for losses based on combinations] Use `Miner` to form effective pairs or triplets, including
   those which utilize a memory bank.
   3. Compute loss.
* **Validation part** consists of several stages:
  1. Accumulating all of the embeddings (`EmbeddingMetrics`).
  2. Calculating distances between them with respect to query/gallery split.
  3. Applying some specific retrieval techniques like query reranking or score normalisation.
  4. Calculating retrieval metrics like CMC@k, Precision@k or MeanAveragePrecision.

## Documentation
Documentation is available via the [link](https://open-metric-learning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Installation
OML is available in PyPI:
```shell script
pip install -U open-metric-learning
```

You can also pull the prepared image from DockerHub or build one by your own
```shell script
docker pull omlteam/oml:gpu
docker pull omlteam/oml:cpu

make docker_build RUNTIME=cpu
make docker_build RUNTIME=gpu
```

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Why do I need OML?</summary>
<p>

You may think *"If I need image embeddings I can simply train a vanilla classifier and take its penultimate layer"*.
Well, it makes sense as a starting point. But there are several possible drawbacks:
* If you want to use embeddings to perform searching you need to calculate some distance among them (for example, cosine or L2).
Usually, you don't directly optimize these distances during the training in the classification setup. So, you can only hope that
final embeddings will have the desired properties.

* The second problem is the validation process.
In the searching setup, you usually care how related your top-N outputs are to the query.
The natural way to evaluate the model is to simulate searching requests to the reference set
and apply one of the retrieval metrics.
So, there is no guarantee that classification accuracy will correlate with these metrics.

* Finally, you may want to implement a metric learning pipeline by yourself.
There is a lot of work: to use triplet loss you need to form batches in a specific way,
implement different kinds of triplets mining, tracking distances, etc. For the validation, you also need to
implement retrieval metrics,
which include effective embeddings accumulation during the epoch, covering corner cases, etc.
It's even harder if you have several gpus and use DDP.
You may also want to visualize your search requests by highlighting good and bad search results.
Instead of doing it by yourself, you can simply use OML for your purposes.

<summary>What is Metric Learning?</summary>
<p>

Metric Learning problem (also known as "extreme classification" problem) means a situation in which we
have thousands of ids of some entities, but only a few samples for every entity.
Often we assume that during the test stage (or production) we will deal with unseen entities
which makes it impossible to apply the vanilla classification pipeline directly. In many cases obtained embeddings
are used to perform search or matching procedures over them.

Here are a few examples of such tasks from the computer vision sphere:
* Person/Animal Re-Identification
* Face Recognition
* Landmark Recognition
* Searching engines for online shops
 and many others.
</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary>Glossary</summary>
<p>

* `embedding` - model's output (also known as `features vector` or `descriptor`).
* `query` - a sample which is used as a request in the retrieval procedure.
* `gallery set` - the set of entities to search items similar to `query` (also known
 as `reference` or `index`).
* `Sampler` - an argument for `DataLoader` which is used to form batches
* `Miner` - the object to form pairs or triplets after the batch was formed by `Sampler`. It's not necessary to form
the combinations of samples only inside the current batch, thus, the memory bank may be a part of `Miner`.
* `Samples`/`Labels`/`Instances` - as an example let's consider DeepFashion dataset. It includes thousands of
 fashion item ids (we name them `labels`) and several photos for each item id
 (we name the individual photo as `instance` or `sample`). All of the fashion item ids have their groups like
  "skirts", "jackets", "shorts" and so on (we name them `categories`).
  Note, we avoid using the term `class` to avoid misunderstanding.
* `training epoch` - batch samplers which we use for combination-based losses usually have a length equal to
[number of labels in training dataset] / [numbers of labels in one batch]. It means that we don't observe all of
the available training samples in one epoch (as opposed to vanilla classification),
instead, we observe all of the available labels.
</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary>What about Self-Supervised Learning?</summary>
<p>

Recent research in SSL definitely obtained great results. The problem is that these approaches
required an enormous amount of computing to train the model. But in our framework, we consider the most common case
when the average user has no more than a few GPUs.

At the same time, it would be unwise to ignore success in this sphere, so we still exploit it in two ways:
* As a source of checkpoints that would be great to start training with. From publications and our experience,
they are much better as initialisation than the default supervised model trained on ImageNet. Thus, we added the possibility
to initialise your models using these pretrained checkpoints only by passing an argument in the config or the constructor.
* As a source of inspiration. For example, we adapted the idea of a memory bank from MoCo for the
TripletLoss.

<details>
<summary>Do I need to know other frameworks to use OML?</summary>
<p>

No, you don't. OML is a framework-agnostic. Despite we use PyTorch Lightning as a loop
runner for the experiments, we also keep the possibility to run everything on pure PyTorch.
Thus, only the tiny part of OML is Lightning-specific and we keep this logic separately from
other code (see `oml.lightning`). Even when you use Lightning, you don't need to know it, since
we provide ready to use [Config API](https://github.com/OML-Team/open-metric-learning/blob/main/examples/).

The possibility of using pure PyTorch and modular structure of the code leaves a room for utilizing
OML with your favourite framework after the implementation of the necessary wrappers.

</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary>Can I use OML without any knowledge in DataScience?</summary>
<p>

Yes. To run the experiment with [Config API](https://github.com/OML-Team/open-metric-learning/blob/main/examples/)
you only need to write a converter
 to our format (it means preparing the
`.csv` table with 5 predefined columns).
That's it!

Probably we already have a suitable pre-trained model for your domain
in our *Models Zoo*. In this case, you don't even need to train it.
</p>
</details>


## Get started using Config API
Using configs is the best option if your dataset and pipeline are standard enough or if you are not
experienced in Machine Learning or Python. You can find more details in the
[examples](https://github.com/OML-Team/open-metric-learning/blob/main/examples/).

## Get started using Python
The most flexible, but knowledge-requiring approach.
You are not limited by our project structure and you can use only that part of the functionality which you need.
You can start with fully working code snippets below that train and validate the model
on a tiny dataset of
[figures](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1plPnwyIkzg51-mLUXWTjREHgc1kgGrF4?usp=sharing).

Note, that the models above expect the crop of the region of interest rather than the whole picture.

You can specify the desired weights and architecture and automatically download pretrained checkpoint (by the analogue with `torchvision.models`).
However, you may also do it manually by the link in `weights` column.

# We are downloading vits16 pretrained on CARS dataset:
model = ViTExtractor(weights="vits16_cars", arch="vits16", normalise_features=False)

# You can also check other available pretrained models...
print(list(ViTExtractor.pretrained_models.keys()))

# ...or check other available types of architectures
print(oml.registry.models.MODELS_REGISTRY)

# It's also possible to use `weights` argument to directly pass the path to the checkpoint:
