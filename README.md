OML is a PyTorch-based framework to train and validate the models producing high-quality embeddings.

## Documentation
Documentation is available via the [link](https://open-metric-learning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


## Get started using Config API
Using configs is the best option if your dataset and pipeline are standard enough or if you are not
experienced in Machine Learning or Python. You can find more details in the
[examples](https://github.com/OML-Team/open-metric-learning/blob/main/examples/).
