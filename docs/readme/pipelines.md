Pipelines provide a way to run metric learning experiments via changing only the config file.
All you need is to prepare your dataset in a required format.

See [Pipelines](https://github.com/OML-Team/open-metric-learning/blob/main/pipelines/) folder for more details:
* Feature extractor [pipeline](https://github.com/OML-Team/open-metric-learning/tree/main/pipelines/features_extraction)
* Retrieval re-ranking [pipeline](https://github.com/OML-Team/open-metric-learning/tree/main/pipelines/postprocessing)
