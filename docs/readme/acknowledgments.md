The project was started in 2020 as a module for [Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst) library.
I want to thank people who worked with me on that module:
[Julia Shenshina](https://github.com/julia-shenshina),
[Nikita Balagansky](https://github.com/elephantmipt),
[Sergey Kolesnikov](https://github.com/Scitator)
and others.

I would like to thank people who continue working on this pipeline when it became a separe project:
[Julia Shenshina](https://github.com/julia-shenshina),
[Misha Kindulov](https://github.com/b0nce),
[Aron Dik](https://github.com/dapladoc),
[Aleksei Tarasov](https://github.com/DaloroAT) and
[Verkhovtsev Leonid](https://github.com/leoromanovich).

I also want to thank NewYorker, since the part of functionality was developed (and used) by its computer vision team led by me.
