Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also boost retrieval accuracy of your features extractor by adding a postprocessor (we recommend
to check the examples above first).
In the example below we train a siamese model to re-rank top retrieval outputs of the original model
by performing inference on pairs ``(query, output_i)`` where ``i=1..top_n``.
