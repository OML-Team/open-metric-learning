To reuse as many OML's functions as possible, you need to prepare a `.csv` file in the required format.
It's not obligatory, especially if you implement your own Dataset in Python, but the format is required in case
of usage built-in datasets or Config-API. You can find the tiny example dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1plPnwyIkzg51-mLUXWTjREHgc1kgGrF4).

Required columns:
* `label` - integer value indicates the label.
* `path` - path to sample. It may be global or relative path (in these case you need to pass `dataset_root` to build-in Datasets.)
* `split` - must be one of 2 values: `train` or `validation`.
* `is_query`, `is_gallery` - have to be `None` where `split == train` and `True` (or `1`)
  or `False` (or `0`) where `split == validation`. Note, that both values can be `True` at
  the same time. Then we will validate every item
  in the validation set using the "1 vs rest" approach (datasets of this kind are `SOP`, `CARS196` or `CUB`).

Optional columns:
* `category` - category which groups sets of similar labels (like `dresses`, or `furniture`).
* `x_1`, `x_2`, `y_1`, `y_2` - integers, the format is `left`, `right`, `top`, `bot` (`x_1` and `y_1` must be less than `x_2` and `y_2`).
  If only part of your images has bounding boxes, just fill the corresponding row with empty values.

are the tables examples for the public datasets. You can also use helper to check if your dataset
is in the right format:
```python
import pandas as pd
from oml.utils.dataframe_format import check_retrieval_dataframe_format

check_retrieval_dataframe_format(df=pd.read_csv("/path/to/your/table.csv"), dataset_root="/path/to/your/datasets/root/")
```
